#### This project is under construction. The first release is not yet scheduled.

This is a Rust port of [_Lingua_](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua), the most accurate natural language detection library for the JVM. It aims at eliminating a problem of many already existing libraries in this field, namely the correct language detection of very short text fragments.

As soon as the first release has been published, a comparison to [_whatlang_](https://github.com/greyblake/whatlang-rs), the so far dominant natural language detection library in the Rust ecosystem, will be provided.

For any further information at this point, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua/blob/master/README.md) of _Lingua's_ JVM implementation.
